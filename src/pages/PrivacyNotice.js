            Zeeguu is a research project. Our goal is to discover ways in which
            learning a foreign language is more fun.

            The only personal information that we store about you is your email.
            We do not share it with anybody. We need it to send you a reset
            password code, important announcements about the platform, and
            possibly a survey at some point.

            We store anonymized data about your interactions with foreign texts
            and exercises together with the times of these interactions. They
            help us estimate the words you know, the ones you should learn,
            recommend texts, and approximate time spent studying.
          </p>

          <p>
            We might make the anonymized interaction data available for other
            researchers too. In research, data can be even more important than
            algorithms.
